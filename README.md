```

### Content Strategy
1. **AI generates** viral video scripts for high-ticket products
2. **Automation posts** 5 videos/day at optimal times
3. **Faceless content** = scalable (no need to be on camera)
4. **Link-in-bio** drives traffic to Amazon affiliate links
5. **Analytics track** what works, optimize continuously

### Funnel Optimization

5,000 profile visits
    ↓ 40% link click rate
2,000 link clicks
    ↓ 50% Amazon visit rate
1,000 Amazon visits
