# 🎬 Example Workflow - From Setup to $1,000/Day

This example shows a complete workflow using the automation system.

## Scenario

**Goal:** Generate content for high-ticket products and track progress toward $1,000/day

---

## Step 1: Product Research

```bash
npm run product-research
```

**Output:**
```
🎯 TOP PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS (HIGH PRIORITY):

1. Premium Mattress (King)
   Category: Furniture (8%)
   Price Range: $1250-$2500
   Commission: $100.00-$200.00
   Sales needed for $1K: 5/day
```

**Action:** Select "Premium Mattress" as our first product to promote.

---

## Step 2: Content Generation (Manual Example)

Since AI generation requires OpenAI API, here's what the system would generate:

### Generated Hook Options:
1. "This $1,800 mattress saved me from $3,000/year in chiropractor bills"
2. "POV: You're tired of waking up with back pain when this exists"
3. "Why I spent $1,800 on a mattress (and don't regret it)"

### Generated Script (30 seconds):
```
[0-2s] HOOK: "Stop wasting money on back pain treatments when this exists"

[3-10s] BUILD-UP: 
"I used to spend $250/month on chiropractor visits
That's $3,000 a year just to sleep without pain
Then I found this"

[11-20s] DEMONSTRATION:
Shows premium mattress features:
- Memory foam layers
- Pressure point relief
- 365-night trial
- 10-year warranty

[21-25s] ROI PROOF:
"Paid $1,800 once
Saved $3,000 in year one
Never going back"

[26-30s] CTA:
"Link in bio - still on sale
Free shipping + 365 night trial
You literally can't lose"
```

### Generated Caption:
```
Best investment I made this year 😴 

Over 10,000 sold this month! Currently 20% off (rarely happens)

Link in bio before price goes up 🔗

## Step 3: Create Video

**Using CapCut (free):**

1. Record faceless footage:
   - Hands unboxing mattress
   - POV setting up bedroom
   - Before/after bedroom shots
   - Close-ups of mattress quality

2. Add voiceover:
   - Use script from Step 2
   - Record with phone or use AI voiceover

3. Add text overlays:
   - "$250/month in pain"
   - "$1,800 one-time"
   - "$3,000 saved in year 1"

4. Add trending audio as background music

5. Export as vertical video (1080x1920)

---

## Step 4: Setup Amazon Link

**Using the Link Generator (index.html):**

1. Find mattress on Amazon: 
   `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GFW4XXX`

2. Enter your affiliate tag: 
   `yourname-20`

3. Generate link:
   `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GFW4XXX?tag=yourname-20&linkCode=ll1`

4. Add to link-in-bio tool (Linktree/Stan Store)

---

## Step 5: Setup Link-in-Bio

**Stan Store Structure:**
```

- 6:35 AM - Post to Instagram Reels
- Engage with comments first 30 minutes

**Posting Details:**
- Video length: 28 seconds
- Caption: Generated in Step 2

3. "Update" - 30-day review

Add 2 new products:
- Ergonomic Office Chair ($800 - $64 commission)
- Robot Vacuum ($600 - $48 commission)

**Week 1 Posting:**
- 5 videos/day × 7 days = 35 videos
- Mix of 3 products
- Same posting times

npm run analytics:summary 7
```
